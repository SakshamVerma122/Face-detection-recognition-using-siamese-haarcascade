Abstract
The rise in crime and security breaches has led to an increasing demand for effective surveillance systems. One such system is equipped with face recognition technology, which has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to accurately identify individuals. In this system, cameras capture images of individuals in the area being monitored, and these images are analyzed using machine learning algorithms to match them with known faces in a database.

Steps:
It takes inside an image of any size.
Then a face detection algorithm is applied to it.
After the face is detected, it is cropped out of the image such that its size equals 100x100x3.
Then it’s passed to a face recognition model.
The system can be used for various applications, including access control, crowd management, and criminal investigations. The development of surveillance systems equipped with face recognition technology has provided a valuable tool for improving security and safety in various settings.

Introduction
This documentation is about a Surveillance System with face detection and face recognition which has two main functionalities:

Face Detection
Face Recognition
Algorithms used:
For Face Recognition:

Siamese Neural Networks
Siamese neural networks are a type of neural network architecture used for face detection and other similarity-based tasks. In the context of face detection, a Siamese neural network is typically trained on pairs of images to learn a similarity metric that can be used to determine whether two images contain the same person's face or not.
The Siamese architecture consists of two identical sub-networks, which are trained on pairs of images and produce feature vectors that represent each image. The two feature vectors are then compared using a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, to determine the similarity between the two images.
In the case of face detection, a Siamese network can be trained on pairs of images, with one image containing a known face and the other containing an unknown face. The network learns to produce feature vectors that are similar for images containing the same face and dissimilar for images containing different faces. This can be used to create a face recognition system that can identify a person from a database of known faces.
Siamese networks have been shown to be effective for face detection and face recognition tasks, particularly when dealing with small datasets or situations where there is significant variation in lighting, pose, or other factors. However, they can be computationally expensive to train and may require significant resources, such as GPUs, to achieve good performance.
Images are passed parallelly through two Siamese Neural Networks, and the embeddings are subtracted (L1Dist), followed by a binary classification algorithm. Adam’s optimizer and Binary Cross Entropy are used as the loss function.
